The idea behind the [Software Craftsmanship newsletter](https://scnewsletter.firebaseapp.com/) is to inspire developers.
 
It is not an official newsletter of the [Software Craftsmanship movement](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) whatsoever, but it's just my personal way to give back to this amazing community of people passionate about software.

This newsletter is open to contribution from everyone. Even if you don't find something to share, you can still leave your feedback on what other people have found. 

## Contribution guide
* **Technology agnostic**. Everything that you think is inspiring for you as a developer will surely inspire other people as well. Specific technologies have their own newsletter already. But still, it's up to you to decide whether or not the article deserves to be shared anyway :open_hands:.
* **Pull requests:**
	* please do a pull requests against the file named _newsletter-x-open.md_. There will always be only one file named _open_.
	* The issues that have already been published are named _newsletter-x-published.md_
	* *Scheleton of your pull request:* along with the link, please add the category (see below) and a quick description about why you think it's interesting.
* **Categories**. The links in the newsletter are categorized to make it easier for the reader to decide what to see first.
	* Categories are: _Articles_ , _Videos_, _Podcasts_, _Events_
	* Feel free to propose new categories, or to change these ones.
* **Comment and vote**. Everyone is free to comment on the pull requests so that everyone can participate to the choice of the material to be sent in every issue. 

Thank you! :blush:
