## Content Suggestions

**Technology agnostic**. Everything that you think is inspiring for you as a developer will surely inspire other people as well. Specific technologies have their own newsletter already. But still, it's up to you to decide whether or not the article deserves to be shared anyway :open_hands:.

You have two ways to contribute: 

1. **Open an issue** with the following information:
  * The link to the content
  * A brief description
  * An explanation of why you think it is interesting
2. **Or do pull request** on the latest _newsletter-x-open.md_ file adding your links. Travis will check if your link is a duplicate.
