## Content Suggestions

**Technology agnostic**. Everything that you think is inspiring for you as a developer will surely inspire other people as well. Specific technologies have their own newsletter already. But still, it's up to you to decide whether or not the article deserves to be shared anyway :open_hands:.

**How to contribute**

1. Create a pull request on the latest _newsletter-x-open.md_ file adding your links. Travis will check if your link is a duplicate. Please, explain the reason why you think this article is worth sharing. Be as much explanatory as you can so that it can be used as _abstract_ when the article will be published in the issue.
